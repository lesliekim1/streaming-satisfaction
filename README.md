# Streaming Satisfaction ML

A personal machine learning project to analyze customer satisfaction on Netflix using a dataset I collected.

## Project Overview
This project involves:
- **Data preprocessing** and feature engineering
- **Train-test splitting** to evaluate model performance
- **Pipeline setup** to streamline transformations and modeling
- **Hyperparameter tuning** using GridSearch for optimization

## Hyperparameter Tuning
To optimize model performance, I will be using **GridSearchCV** to systematically explore hyperparameters and select the best combination.

## Note
The dataset used in this project is private due to confidentiality reasons and will not be publicly shared.
